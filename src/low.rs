//! Low-level GPIO building blocks used by the `ayo` crate.
//!
//! This module defines a small, platform-facing API that the higher-level
//! typed abstractions use. It intentionally exposes a minimal, unsafe
//! boundary (raw pointers to register blocks) so platform crates can provide
//! zero-cost wrappers over their hardware register maps.
//!
//! The documentation below includes short examples showing how a platform
//! crate might implement the required traits. The examples are illustrative
//! and marked `no_run` to avoid being executed as doctests â€” they should be
//! adapted to your MCU's actual register layout (for example an svd2rust
//! generated register block).
//!
//! Safety notes:
//! - The `Bank::addr()` pointer must be valid and point to the correct
//!   register block for the lifetime of operations. Dereferencing an invalid
//!   pointer is undefined behavior.
//! - Implementations should use volatile reads/writes (or generated accessors)
//!   to avoid compiler reordering and ensure side effects reach the hardware.
//! - Concurrent access (from interrupts or multiple cores) must be handled
//!   by the platform crate (e.g. with critical sections or atomic/lock
//!   mechanisms) if required by the hardware.

/// Abstraction representing a GPIO bank on the target platform.
///
/// A concrete bank type (provided by a platform-specific crate) must
/// implement `Bank<R>` for its register block `R`. The trait provides the
/// physical address of the registers and a convenience `get_handle()` that
/// returns an `io::Gpio<R>` wrapper around the register pointer.
pub trait Bank<R: register::GpioRegisters> {
    /// Return a new `Gpio` handle pointing at the bank's register block.
    ///
    /// This default implementation calls `Self::addr()` and constructs the
    /// thin `io::Gpio` wrapper. Platform crates may rely on this helper
    /// to obtain a typed handle.
    fn get_handle() -> io::Gpio<R> {
        io::Gpio::new(Self::addr())
    }

    /// Return the base pointer to the register block for this bank.
    fn addr() -> *mut R;
}

// Example: providing a `Bank` for `MyGpioRegs`.
//
// ```no_run
// pub struct MyBank;
//
// impl Bank<MyGpioRegs> for MyBank {
//     fn addr() -> *mut MyGpioRegs {
//         0x4002_0000 as *mut MyGpioRegs // platform-specific base address
//     }
// }
// ```
